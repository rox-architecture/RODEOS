Create a markdown file with a description of all attached AAS submodels. These descriptions will be used afterwards to decide which submodel fits best (or if one submodel fits at all) for a specific input. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain a clear separation between the submodels in the descriptions, while also keeping each description as generic as possible.

Only return the markdown file.
